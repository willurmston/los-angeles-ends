                october 2010 and i feel like i'm sinking. i stumble out of bed, wander into the living room.

                my mom is sitting down, sipping a cappuccino, word document open on her titanium powerbook g4.

                light floods through the windows.

                i was fifteen when my mom was diagnosed with cancer. it was the year i learned how to drive.

                growing up in beachwood canyon, there was nowhere in the neighborhood to walk and only one bus that could take me into the city.

                driving was the only way out.

                i remember my first time behind the wheel, in a silver prius owned by melrose driving school.

                i went down western to 3rd street, across 3rd to la cienega, up la cienega to sunset, west on sunset to coldwater, then up coldwater to mulholland, tracing the line between the los angeles basin and the san fernando valley.

                i'm not sure that i said a single word.

                i got my license from the glendale dmv in november 2009, a month after my mom died.

                i took it to valley parties, mostly, where a certain type of anhedonia could always be amplified.

                the san fernando valley, bounded by the santa monica mountains in the south, the santa susanas in the northwest, the simi hills to the west, the verdugos to the east, and the san gabriels to the northeast, is naturally dry.

                the tongva lived there for generations before spanish colonizers arrived in the 1770s and established their first settlement — rancho encino, after the oaks that populated so much of the valley.

                a century later, in-laws j.b. lankershim and isaac van nuys built an empire on dry crops, transporting wheat from encino to san pedro, san pedro to europe.

                in the early 1900s, a group of landholders — including harrison otis, the publisher of the *los angeles times*; henry huntington, executive of the southern pacific railroad; fred eaton, former mayor of los angeles; and william mulholland, a civil engineer — started buying up parcels in the valley.

                otis used his paper to stoke fear that los angeles would soon run dry, championing an aqueduct built by mulholland to bring water to the city from the owens valley, over 400 miles away.

                when the aqueduct's final route was revealed, it ran directly through the land that otis, huntington, eaton, and mulholland had purchased.

                the san fernando valley, rich with irrigated orange groves, was incorporated into the city of los angeles in 1915.

                after the aqueduct, los angeles exploded in acreage and populatation.

                one night, after a valley party but before i slept on the floor in someone's guest room, my friends and i went up to the encino ave footbridge.

                a spiral staircase took us up above the 101, each passing car a blast of wind that buckled our knees.

                we played frogger, darting back and forth to dodge the shadows of every car that passed below.

                been wondering about you

                last time we spoke was in a dream
                you asked me if we could go for a drive
                "it's good to have you back," i said
                then i woke up, and tore through the east side

                a different point of view it can't be true

                if i were stronger i would
                split in two

                i feel an urgency so blue

                in that last year i learned to drive
                banished from the house to 101
                i sped through ice cold valley light
                and cried in horror in the drive-thru line

                8 years i wrote just one song
