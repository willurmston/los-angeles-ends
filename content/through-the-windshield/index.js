                as the light on sunset turns from yellow to red, a car swerves through the intersection and into the driver-side door.

                it speeds away, pushing off the side panel. i see only headlights.

                my turn signal blinks off leo's taco truck sign.

                right before my mom moved to los angeles, she was in a car crash too.

                it was 1985, seven years before i was born.

                her mother stopped the car short.

                not wearing a seatbelt, my mom flew through the windshield.

                completed in 1904, sunset boulevard traces a 1780s cattle route along base of the santa monica mountains.

                it begins near the [zanja madre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3vKQNIsADQ), an aqueduct built by spanish colonizers to carry water from the los angeles river, and ends in the pacific palisades, where it hits the ocean.

                originally called cahuenga road no. 2, in 1885 western avenue was re-named for a what was then a cardinal boundary of the city's development.

                it runs in a straight line, uninterrupted from los feliz boulevard in the hollywood hills to the pacific ocean in san pedro, the second-longest north-south street in the city.

                like so many before me, i came to los angeles to play myself.

                but then there i was, stalled out at the corner of sunset and western, cast in a reboot.

                and i couldn't even break the frame.

                born to the freeway and radio masts

                crashed turning left, sunset and western
                i was trying to go home

                looked through the windshield, saw both of my parents
                grabbed my keys, got back in the car
                right hand scans the AM bands
                but this time i hit traffic
                and the radio went static

                car stalled, engine silent
